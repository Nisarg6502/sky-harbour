From the spicy dishes of Andhra Pradesh, we bring you Guntur Chilli, known for its fiery heat and exported worldwide. Byadgi chilli, from the charming town of Byadgi in Karnataka, offers a milder, more flavorful experience.  <br /><br /> But what's unique is that each of these red chillies comes with a Scoville Heat Unit (SHU) rating, which measures their spiciness. Our range spans from the milder Byadgi chilli with an SHU of 50,000 to 100,000, similar to a Thai pepper, to the fiery Guntur Chilli with an SHU of 35,000 to 40,000, hotter than cayenne pepper. <br /><br /> So, explore the regions, experience the flavors, and choose the spice level that suits your culinary adventures.</p>
